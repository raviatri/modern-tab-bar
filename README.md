# modern-tab-bar
To achieve synchronized scrolling in Flutter where both the parent widget and the child list inside TabBarView scroll together, you can use the NestedScrollView widget. This allows you to scroll a header (parent) and a body (TabBarView), where the header scrolls up and sticks to the top when the body (child) starts scrolling.
